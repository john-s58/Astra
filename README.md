# Astra
## A Math and Machine Learning Library Written In Rust
Status:
Conv2d net does not train well
missing a lot of tests (for tensor, for convolution and dense)
some decoupling needed in Tensor, Dense
need to add optimizers
need to add ability to save and load models

### Goals:
- [ ] working conv2d net by 05/10/2023
current code quality raised to "production level" - decoupling, optimized, clean, tests


### Longer Distance Goals:
add macros for tensor, layers, net
add statistics and machine learning algorithms
